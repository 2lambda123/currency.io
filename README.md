# currency.io
A offline-capable, html5 currency converter app for the iPhone.  
Visit <http://currency.io> on your iOS/Android phone to try it out.

### Goals
See how close we could get to building something that felt like a real native app.

### Javascript libraries
Everything is built with raw html, css & javascript. We have decided against including a library like Zepto or jQuery. With the main browser targets being Android and iOS browsers, we can use querySelectorAll and addEventListener which covers most of what a library gives us anyway. Plus it cuts down on the filesize, which is especially important when dealing with mobile.

### Images
Modern browsers means solid base64 support. So, the majority of images have been base64 encoded and inlined to cut down on requests (see `/public/stylesheets/images.css` & `/public/stylesheets/images-x2.css`).

### The app
The app itself is running on Sinatra. It doesn't do anything fancy, it's just there to query and parse current currency rates from Yahoo. If you haven't used Sinatra before, all the markup is static and sits within the `/views` folder, with each chunk of markup wrapped by `layout.erb`.

### Other notes
- Developing strictly for Android/iOS kicks ass.
  - No need for graceful degradation
  - querySelector & querySelectorAll
  - Native JSON parsing (in iOS 3.2+)
  - ApplicationCache & localStorage
  - A consistent XMLHttpRequest implementation
  - Full CSS3 support â€” including transitions & animations
- We're using an image to do the small drop shadows rather than using `box-shadow`, which turns out to be horrible for mobile performance.
